Thirty-three programs done for an entry-level Rosalind course on Boinformatics, relatively simple programs
that splice and decode information from different forms of DNA sequences. Used mostly as exercises for
learning Ruby. Sorry for the documentation on each program being spotty, I will hope to update this in the
future for any potential onlookers.
